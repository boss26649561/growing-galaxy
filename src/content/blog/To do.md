## High Priority

- Displaying Front Page with sliding images of blogs and projects
- Better Color themes
- Adding a tag component to reuse
- Better display layout for blog and project pages
- Fixing up the about page -> maybe add some tags
- Fixing up components overlapping in the projects, CSS seems to carry to over from each other so when you open up the subreddit project, the first task manager project gets affected

## Lower Priority

- Sorting posts by last updated
- Using table of contents in longer md files

### Later Projects

- playing around with databases and sql
- Making e commerce pages
- Login and auth systems
- Playing around with AI
