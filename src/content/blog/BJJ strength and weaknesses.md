## Strengths

<img src="/Strengths.png" width="128" style={}>

- Athleticism and explosiveness -> better escapes and passes
- Reactive wrestling -> sometimes able to land in better positions/reverse
- Taking the back and maintaining back control
- Flexibility and good ability to invert -> leads to good guard retention and chances to attack the legs or take the back

## Weaknesses

<img src="/Weaknesses.png" width="128">

- Cardio and conditioning
- Getting head controlled = pass/submitted
- Finishing crossface pass -> not finishing the pass very often
- Offensive wrestling -> shooting for doubles, speed should be my advantage
- Advancing positions after a pass, especially side control
- Submission game
