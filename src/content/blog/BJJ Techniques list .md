Maintaining and transitioning from side control -> probably my weakest offensive position
Properly passing with crossface from half guard

## Definite Improvements

# Omoplata defense

Used to instantly force roll and look for a scramble after the roll but I realised that the roll defense should be a last resort defense and I should be
trying to posture first and feel how the opponent is using the control. After the posture if they cannot break down the posture, I can look to circle around the opposite side of the arm attack and look to establish side control. If they kick the omoplata hard I can also look to post with both my free hand and head and look to cartwheel over and look for side control. Need to be cautious of bicep slicers as the hand may still be vulnerable.

# Closed guard posturing

Learned the proper closed guard posture to stop posture breaks. The two main points to keep in mind are to keep the turtleback posture (with sitting back on the lower part of the feet) and most importantly where the knee is placed. Previously my knee placement was the mistake I was making in keeping the posture, I need to make sure they arent too wide apart or too close together but right beside the opponents hips so when they do try to pull I can both sit back and utilise the knee clench to stop the posture break without using my hands at all.

# Triangle defense and general guard defense

Similar to my omoplata defense, previously whenever I got caught in a triangle, my first line of defense is to posture up, gain height and put both feet on the opponents hips to look to escape. This defense should be used as a last resort and I should be looking to attempt to shut down the opponents hips before they can angle and look of the triangle. This can be done by firstly closing the distance (so they can't put their feet into the hips), using the trapped arm elbow as posture, opposite arm relieving neck pressure and then shifting our body weight to the opposite side of the trapped arm and then stepping out and really pressuring the hip with our trapped arm side knees. This knee pressure can also be used to shut down offensive guard techniques such as armbars as the opponent needs to shift their hips to be able to get the angle to hit the armbar.
