### Why it is one of my favourite sports

I think that its quite unique in the way that everybody of all types can learn and be good at jiu-jitsu by playing around and experimenting with the thousands of techniques out there and even new ones that are still being made up by random practioners. In every technique there are its own nuances and different ways to perform the techniques with preferences as well. A good example of this is the usage of a guillotine choke, there are over 10s of variations of grips that people swear by but may not work or feel right for other people.

One thing I realised to a game like RPGs which is one of my favourite genre of games. You can think of people as characters with base stats

### What it takes to perform well at competitions

Most successful competitors in this sport tend to have incredibly strong strengths that they play to. One of Bruce Lees most famous quotes "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." stand incredibly true for this sport. Some of the most feared competitors have techniques that they are known for and people will try to avoid their strengths and end up giving up something else.

### What does my current game look like

Jack of all trades, master of none would be the best way to describe my current game. Back takes and inversions with the berimbolo is something I feel quite comfortable with but I feel like this style is more effective in gi compared to no gi.

### What should I be focusing on

Really trying to think about developing a game to be able to compete at competitions.
