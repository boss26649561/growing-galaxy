## Strengths

<img src="/Strengths.png" width="128" style={}>

- Athleticism and explosiveness -> better escapes and passes
- Reactive wrestling -> sometimes able to land in better positions/reverse
- Taking the back and maintaining back control
- Flexibility and good ability to invert -> leads to good guard retention and chances to attack the legs or take the back

## Weaknesses

<img src="/Weaknesses.png" width="128">

- Cardio and conditioning
- Getting head controlled = pass/submitted
- Finishing crossface pass -> not finishing the pass very often
- Offensive wrestling -> shooting for doubles, speed should be my advantage
- Advancing positions after a pass, especially side control
- Submission game

## Why it is one of my favourite sports

I have always really enjoyed martials and combat sports from high school. I have tried out most traditional sports and martials arts such as taekwondo, karate, wing chun, judo, boxing and muay thai but brazilian jiu-jitsu (grappling) has stood out to me the most. Known as the gentle art, this sport is one of the more modern martials arts developed. People train martial arts for a wide range of reasons such as health, fitness, social aspects and the confidence that they can defend themselves. However from my experience for the training to be effective I believe that the techniques need to be used against active opponents. Without this aspect of active training, there is no way to use the techniques trained if a bad situation was to happen.

One of the most interesting thing about jiu-jitsu(or grappling) is the huge variety of techniques we can use. These techniques are designed to be effective against humans so if you are planning on fighting other animals this sport may not be for you. Depending on body size, atheletiscm, flexibility etc there are moves suited to everybody. In every technique there are its own nuances and different ways to perform the techniques as well. A good example of this is the usage of a guillotine choke, there are over 10s of variations of grips that are used but some grips work well in specific scenarios and also may not feel good to others simply to everyone having different body structures/ wrist flexibility etc.

A funny thing I realised was the similarity of this sport to RPG games. Unlike other sports there are simply too many options in grappling so you really have to be careful in distributing time to specific techniques to be an effective grappler. I could spend 6 months working on armbars but if I can't get to position to be able to arm bar then that time is essentially wasted. If I want to be an arm bar specialist what path would I go then? Most likely either through playing a strong guard game to hit armbars off my back by practising pulling guards, closed guard fundamentals and guard retention. I could also go for the other route of wrestling and looking for takedowns into passes then attacking my armbars from a dominant top control like the mount or sidecontrol.

## What it takes to perform well at competitions

Most successful competitors in this sport tend to have incredibly strong strengths that they play to. One of Bruce Lees most famous quotes "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." stand incredibly true for this sport. Some of the most feared competitors have techniques that they are known for and people will try to avoid their strengths and end up giving up something else.

## What does my current game look like

Jack of all trades, master of none would be the best way to describe my current game. Back takes and inversions with the berimbolo is something I feel quite comfortable with but I feel like this style is more effective in gi compared to no gi.

## What should I be focusing on

Really trying to think about developing a game to be able to compete at competitions.

# Positions

Should contain sweeps/passes/submissions in each applicable category

- Closed guard
- Side control
- mount
- Back control
- half guard
- Octopus guard
- Deep half
- butter fly guard
- Dog fight

- DLR
- Reverse DLR

- Wedge
- Crab ride

- X guard
- 50/50
- Saddle/ Sankaku

- Standing/Wrestling

- Passing

# Currently working on/ bigger focus

## Submissions

head arm choke, naked guillotine and arm in guillotine

## Wrestling

Finishing single legs needs to be a big focus. Also need to think about the pass right after the takedown
Some options to play around when opponent uses the knee shield defense

passing leg to back and doing the standard pulling hip down takedown (high percentage when leg is passed)

Framing on their opposite shoulder and going for an inside trip

Dropping leg into a blast double

## Maintaining and transitioning

From side control -> probably my weakest offensive position

## Properly passing with crossface from half guard

Really need to play around getting a strong crossface in this position. In Gi making use of the tail to secure and in no gi really making sure to misalign the spine.

# Experimental

### Giant killer triangle choke

Getting distance back as soon as I lock an approximate triangle to avoid getting stacked. If I can get even mroe distance, I can put my locking leg into the opponents hips to completely stop their mobility. Really nasty triangle variation, have to be careful about putting people to sleep.

### Reverse triangle/teepee/fistchoke/pushing defending elbow

4 great options to finish triangles when opponents hides arm to relieve the pressure on one side of the neck. With the first two options, really important to keep posture broken when transitioning to these attacks.

### Leg positions with armbars

Need to play around with zombie arm bars and the craig jones arm bar

# Definite Improvements I have made to my game

## Omoplata defense

Used to instantly force roll and look for a scramble after the roll but I realised that the roll defense should be a last resort defense and I should be
trying to posture first and feel how the opponent is using the control. After the posture if they cannot break down the posture, I can look to circle around the opposite side of the arm attack and look to establish side control. If they kick the omoplata hard I can also look to post with both my free hand and head and look to cartwheel over and look for side control. Need to be cautious of bicep slicers as the hand may still be vulnerable.

## Closed guard posturing

Learned the proper closed guard posture to stop posture breaks. The two main points to keep in mind are to keep the turtleback posture (with sitting back on the lower part of the feet) and most importantly where the knee is placed. Previously my knee placement was the mistake I was making in keeping the posture, I need to make sure they arent too wide apart or too close together but right beside the opponents hips so when they do try to pull I can both sit back and utilise a knee clench to stop the posture break without using my hands at all. If I dont need to use my hands then I can start looking to use both hands to look to break and pass.

## Triangle defense and general guard defense

Similar to my omoplata defense, previously whenever I got caught in a triangle, my first line of defense is to posture up, gain height and put both feet on the opponents hips to look to escape. This defense should be used as a last resort and I should be looking to attempt to shut down the opponents hips before they can angle and look of the triangle. This can be done by firstly closing the distance (so they can't put their feet into the hips), using the trapped arm elbow as posture, opposite arm relieving neck pressure and then shifting our body weight to the opposite side of the trapped arm and then stepping out and really pressuring the hip with our trapped arm side knees. This knee pressure can also be used to shut down offensive guard techniques such as armbars as the opponent needs to shift their hips to be able to get the angle to hit the armbar.
