# Intro

Seeing as I got domain gwu.lol I thought I might as well write some content related to league of legends as well. Currently a jungle main and playing secondary support in diamond. A very useful jungle cheatsheet by perry https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVnhFeGzQLPSkN5DxbNyQiCkxiR1QKlkx2jy6vbG-NI/edit#gid=261800373.

# Recurring mistakes

Forcing ganks and playing around weakside

Walking to fights that are too far away-> just be efficient

Muting pings when they are not being used correctly

Changing to red trinket on Ganking junglers (especially ivern)

Skirmishing 2vs2 with weak laners

Herald usage, better to use then over greeding

# Improvement areas

Can I punish jungler for showing?

Can I punish a laner for roaming?

leaving dead plays

Efficency is key

# Things to keep in mind in game

Pathing for prio/volatility/gank setup -> think about this in loading screen

Do I think they will invade? use defensive wards

Effective vision with first pink -> Either behind red buff or in the brush inbetween opponent gromp and blue

Can I invade first spawn/first buff spawn when really ahead

Where should I be on the map at certain timings ie level 6 mid/top gank timing (5:35)

Where did the laners ward -> How long were they out of vision? Should be able to know how deep they warded based on that information
